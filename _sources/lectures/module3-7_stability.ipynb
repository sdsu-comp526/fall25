    "- **Consistency**: describes how well the numerical scheme aproximates the PDE (if it is at least of order 1 $\\implies$ it is consistent --- The residual reduces under grid refinement).\n",

It is a property of an algorithm rather than the problem being solved (check [Higham's blog](https://nhigham.com/2020/08/04/what-is-numerical-stability/) again).
