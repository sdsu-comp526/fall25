    "# 40) Review of PDEs and practice exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "We will implement a PDE simulation of the [heat equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation).\n",
    "At various points in this exercise, you will have the ability to modify the code to explore different variations on the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The math\n",
    "\n",
    "We will consider a perfectly insulated rod of metal with various conditions along each end.\n",
    "We will only consider the temperature change in 1D for this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The partial differential equation which governs the movement of the heat through this rod is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $u \\left( x, t \\right)$ is the function giving the temperature of the rod at location $x$ and time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $\\Delta u$ or $\\nabla^2 u$ is sometimes used in place of $\\partial^2 u / \\partial x^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this to work, we also need an initial condition $u_0 \\left( x \\right) = u \\left( x, 0 \\right)$ and boundary conditions.\n",
    "For simplicity (and [without loss of generality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Without_loss_of_generality)), we assume $x \\in \\left[ 0, 1 \\right]$.\n",
    "That means we have boundary conditions $u_L \\left( t \\right) = u \\left( 0, t \\right)$ or $u_L \\left( t \\right) = \\partial u / \\partial t \\left( 0, t \\right)$ and $u_R \\left( t \\right) = u \\left( 1, t \\right)$ or $u_R \\left( t \\right) = \\partial u / \\partial t \\left( 1, t \\right)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extension\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we consider boundary conditions that do not vary with time, but this is an area for exploration."
